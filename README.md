•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
First, it is important to understand users’ needs and well as expectations and translate them into clear, actionable items that can be executable.  Creating user stories help by breaking down these needs into manageable tasks that provides a path for the development team to make sure the work being done is aligned with the stakeholders’ expectations. It also provides clarity and flexibility to allow easy integration and adaptability in case new requests are made. 

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Agile processes that I hope to integrate that will enhance developing programs are Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, open communication, iterative development, feedback integration and flexible work structure. This facilitates a collaborative culture and fosters accountability as well as ensuring that the user needs are being met even after backlogs are reviewed and priorities are shifted. 

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development is a member that is willing to collaborate, communicate, support other team members, focus on quality and adapt to changing projects. The success comes from a team’s ability to share ideas and work confidently to maintain transparency and accountability.
